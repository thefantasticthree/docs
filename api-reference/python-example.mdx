### API AUTHENTICATION

The ``API-KEY`` grants access to the ``Forecaster`` services. To obtain this credential, we can request it at the developers portal (available at ``https://dev-predictor-apim.developer.azure-api.net``).

```python
API_KEY = "<<INTRODUCE YOUR API_KEY HERE>>"

headers = {
    'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': API_KEY
}
```

### DATA LOADING + MINIMAL ETL

Load the files from the local storage.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_parquet('Makridakis_Training.parquet')
```

Before feeding the data to the ``engine``, we must ensure it meets the bare minimum requirements:

> It seems some series don't have the ``time`` field properly filled, which would cause the ``forecaster`` to break down. Thus, we must fix this before proceeding.

> Moreover, some series have different termination dates. Since this is not allowed, we must shift the series to a common termination date.

> We'll also ``resample`` the series to monthly frequency, though this is not compulsory and can be handled by the engine (it would suffice to pass an additional ``frequency`` argument in the configuration file we'll make later), but doing it here will allow us to skip the ``preprocessing`` function altogether, which is often convenient.

``` python
def minimal_etl_to_forecaster(df):

    nans = df.groupby('series_id').apply(lambda x: x.isna().sum())
    nans = nans[nans['timestamp'] > 0].index.tolist()
    df = df[~ df['series_id'].isin(nans)]

    current_date = pd.Timestamp(day = 18, month = 9, year = 2023)

    def shift_to_common_termination_date(series):
        series['timestamp'] = series['timestamp'] - series['timestamp'].max() + current_date
        return series

    df = df.groupby('series_id', group_keys = False).apply(shift_to_common_termination_date)
    df = df.groupby('series_id', group_keys = True).resample('MS', on = 'timestamp').sum(numeric_only = True).reset_index()

    return df

df = minimal_etl_to_forecaster(df)
```
