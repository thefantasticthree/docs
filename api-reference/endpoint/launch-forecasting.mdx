**IN** - Dictionary containing the following keys:
- ``ids_parallel_run`` – Dataset(s) ID(s) – \{*key1* : *id1*, *key2* : *id2*, ...\}
- ``refit_and_forecast`` – Refit champion model with all available data and 
use it to forecast the label series
- ``straight_to_forecast`` – Skip the models’ evaluation step and jump 
straight to forecasting
- ``use_unproc_dataset`` – Use the unprocessed dataset(s) for training
- ``filter_out_noisy_series`` – Drop noisy series before fitting the model(s)
- ``models`` – Models to fit
- ``forecast_horizon`` – Number of periods to be forecasted onto the future
- ``n_cross_validations`` – Number of cross-validation-folds for evaluation
- ``models_parameters`` – Optionally, (hyper)parameters for the models (must be dict-like)

**OUT** - \{*key1* : ``job1_id``, *key2* : ``job2_id``, ...\} - Job(s) ID(s)
